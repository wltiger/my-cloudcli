/**
 * The provider the user last chose, shared by chat, the shell, the git panel and
 * the project workspace.
 *
 * It was read from localStorage in six places with four different hand-rolled
 * readers — only one of which validated the stored string — and written from
 * three modules. Nothing published a same-tab change, so the git panel's reader
 * (which listens only for the cross-tab `storage` event) never saw a switch made
 * in its own tab.
 *
 * The value now lives in `auth.db` through the preference store, which notifies
 * its subscribers synchronously — including in the tab that wrote — so the
 * choice both reaches every reader at once and follows the user between devices.

/**
 * Minimal JSON-RPC client for `codex app-server`.
 *
 * Codex ships two entry points and they expose different things. The
 * `@openai/codex-sdk` this app runs conversations through is a wrapper around
 * `codex exec`, and its whole surface is `startThread` and `resumeThread` —
 * there is no way to branch a thread or to resume one partway. The same
 * binary's `app-server` subcommand speaks JSON-RPC and does have that
 * primitive, `thread/fork`, which is what the Codex IDE clients build their
 * own "fork" and "edit an earlier message" on top of.
 *
 * So this is a second transport to the same CLI, opened only for the
 * operations the SDK cannot express. Everything else still goes through the
 * SDK.
